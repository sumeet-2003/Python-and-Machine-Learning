    <h1>Rice Crop Diseases Information</h1>
    
    <h2>Hispa</h2>
    <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Hispa is a common pest in rice crops. The larvae and adults feed on the leaves, causing characteristic shot-hole damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Prevention Measures:</strong> Use insecticides approved for rice crops. Implement cultural practices such as maintaining proper field hygiene and planting resistant rice varieties.</p>
    
    <h2>Brown Spot</h2>
    <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Brown spot is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Bipolaris oryzae. It thrives in warm and humid conditions, often appearing during periods of high rainfall.</p>
    <p><strong>Prevention Measures:</strong> Use fungicides recommended for controlling brown spot. Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging in the fields. Practice crop rotation and maintain proper field hygiene.</p>
    
    <h2>Leaf Blast</h2>
    <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Leaf blast is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen Pyricularia oryzae. It affects leaves, leaf sheaths, nodes, and panicles, leading to significant yield losses.</p>
    <p><strong>Prevention Measures:</strong> Use resistant rice varieties if available. Apply fungicides preventively before symptoms appear. Maintain proper field drainage and avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.</p>
